In this task, you will deepen your understanding of Java Map&Set.

-   Step 1: Create a class 'Medication' with the methods 'getName', 'getPrice', and 'getAvailability'.
-   Step 2: Create a Java class 'Pharmacy' that uses a Java Map to store the Medication name as the key and its information as the value.
-   Step 3: Create a method 'int getCount()' in the class  `Pharmacy`. This method should return the number of Medications in the pharmacy.
-   Step 4: Create a method 'void save(Medication medication)' in the class  `Pharmacy`. This method should insert the Medication indexed by its name into the pharmacy.
-   Step 5: Create a method 'Medication find(String medicationName)' in the class  `Pharmacy`. This method should return the requested Medication with this name. If no Medication with this name is found, the method should return null.
-   Step 6: Create a method 'void delete(String medicationName)' in the class  `Pharmacy`. This method should delete the Medication with this name.
-   Step 7: Implement a method to print all Medications in the map, including their name, price, and availability.
